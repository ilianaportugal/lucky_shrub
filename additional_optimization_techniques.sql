## Task 1:
## Below query was created to find how many orders were placed by clients with the following ClientID’s in 2022;C11, C12 and C13
SELECT CONCAT("Cl1: ", COUNT(OrderID), "orders") AS "Total number of orders" FROM Orders WHERE YEAR(Date) = 2022 AND ClientID = "Cl1" UNION SELECT CONCAT("Cl2: ", COUNT(OrderID), "orders") FROM Orders WHERE YEAR(Date) = 2022 AND ClientID = "Cl2" UNION SELECT CONCAT("Cl3: ", COUNT(OrderID), "orders") FROM Orders WHERE YEAR(Date) = 2022 AND ClientID = "Cl3"; 

## Optimize above query using common table expression
WITH 
CL1_Orders AS (SELECT CONCAT("Cl1: ", COUNT(OrderID), "orders") AS "Total number of orders"  
FROM Orders 
WHERE YEAR(Date) = 2022 AND ClientID = "Cl1"), 
CL2_Orders AS (SELECT  CONCAT("Cl2: ", COUNT(OrderID), "orders") 
FROM Orders WHERE YEAR(Date) = 2022 AND ClientID = "Cl2"),

FROM Orders WHERE YEAR(Date) = 2022 AND ClientID = "Cl3") 
SELECT * FROM CL1_Orders
UNION 
SELECT * FROM CL2_Orders
UNION 
SELECT * FROM CL3_Orders; 

## Task 2: Create a prepared statement called GetOrderDetails
## Prepared statement should accept two input arguments: a ClientID value and a year value
## Statement should return the order id, the quantity, the order cost and the order date from the Orders table
PREPARE GetOrderDetail FROM 'SELECT OrderID, Quantity, Cost, Date FROM Orders WHERE ClientID = ? AND YEAR(Date) = ? ';

## Task 3: Utilize the Properties column data to output the product id, name, buy price and sell price of the product where the Order value in the Activity table is True.
## ClientID and ProductID logged in a JSON Properties column in the Activity table
SELECT Activity.Properties ->>'$.ProductID'
AS ProductID, Products.ProductName, Products.BuyPrice, Products.SellPrice 
FROM Products INNER JOIN Activity 
ON Products.ProductID = Activity.Properties ->>'$.ProductID' 
WHERE Activity.Properties ->>'$.Order' = "True";
